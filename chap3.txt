But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor
decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small
choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a
1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem.
The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of
shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are flying
from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX adjusts the
heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of
New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff—the nose of the
airplane moves just a few feet—but when magnified across the entire United
States, you end up hundreds of miles apart.
