THE FATE OF British Cycling changed one day in 2003. The organization, which was
the governing body for professional cycling in Great Britain, had recently hired
Dave Brailsford as its new performance director. At the time, professional
cyclists in Great Britain had endured nearly one hundred years of mediocrity.
Since 1908, British riders had won just a single gold medal at the Olympic
Games, and they had fared even worse in cycling’s biggest race, the Tour de
France. In 110 years, no Britishasdadasd cyclist had ever won the event.
In fact, the performance of British riders had been so underwhelming that one
of the top bike manufacturers in Europe refused to sell bikes to the team because
they were afraid that it would hurt sales if other professionals saw the Brits using
their gear.
